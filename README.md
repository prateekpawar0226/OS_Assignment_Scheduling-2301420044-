## üìù Overview
This project is part of the **DIT (Digital Information Technology)** course.  
It demonstrates the implementation of **[main topic/technology of your project, e.g., CPU Scheduling, Database Management, Web Application]** with practical examples and output visualization.

---

##  Objective
- Explain the **core concept** of [topic].  
- Implement [algorithm/system/process].  
- Analyze and visualize the results for better understanding.

---

##  Features
- Implements **FCFS, SJF, and Round Robin scheduling algorithms**.  
- Calculates **Waiting Time** and **Turnaround Time** for each process.  
- Displays a **Gantt Chart** for Round Robin scheduling.  
- Interactive and easy to run on **Linux/Kali environment**.

---

## üõ† Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** Python 3  
- **Platform:** Linux/Kali Linux  
- **Editor:** VS Code / Nano / Any Python IDE  
- **Libraries:** Only standard Python libraries (no extra install required)

##  How to Run
1. Open terminal in the project folder.  
2. Make sure Python 3 is installed:  
```bash
python3 --version
````

3. Run the script:

```bash
python3 scheduling.py
```

4. Observe the output for FCFS, SJF, and Round Robin scheduling.

## Sample Output

```
--- FCFS Scheduling ---
Process Burst Waiting Turnaround
P1      5     0       5
P2      8     5       13
P3      12    13      25

--- SJF Scheduling ---
Process Burst Waiting Turnaround
P1      5     0       5
P2      8     5       13
P3      12    13      25

--- Round Robin Scheduling (q=4) ---
Gantt Chart:
| P1 | P2 | P3 | P1 | P2 | P3 | P3 |
Process Burst Waiting Turnaround
P1      5     0       5
P2      8     9       17
P3      12    13      25
```

##  Notes

* Burst times and quantum can be modified inside the script.
* Designed for educational purposes to understand **CPU Scheduling**.
